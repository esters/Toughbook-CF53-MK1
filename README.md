# Panasonic Toughbook-CF53

## Model - CF-53DAC20Q2

This is a Work-In-Progress on removing the BIOS Administrator Password by using the methods and tools available online. 
The initial work was done here - https://gist.github.com/en4rab/550880c099b5194fbbf3039e3c8ab6fd
At the moment there are following issues with this device:

* Pressing F2/F10 while on POST asks for the Administrator password 
* Devices, other than the HDD/SDD are capable of booting an OS
* Hard Disk Lock is present in the BIOS and the password is not known
* Device is pre-installed with a Windows 7 SP1 image and has a WinPE recovery partition available.

## BIOS

* Bios Vendor - American Megatrend Inc. (AMI)
* Bios Version - V1.00L15 M91
* Bios Platform - Aptio 4
